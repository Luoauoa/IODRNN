## IODRNN
This is the source code of the model named IODRNN published in the EAAI Journal.
### One word that has been said before 
 **This model was implemented nearly two years ago, sorry for the late...**

This is an unmatured idea, further suggestions and improvements are also welcome.

Please cite our work if you are interested in some of my designs and want to follow them.
